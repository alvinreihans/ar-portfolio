        Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find a showcase of my augmented
        reality project, the culmination of my studies in AR at Lampung
        University. Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital
        information onto the real world, enhancing our perception of reality. In
        this project, I've explored the potential of AR to create immersive and
        interactive experiences. Dive into this project to see how I've applied
        AR technology and the skills I've developed during my academic journey.
        Thank you for taking the time to explore this significant piece of my
        educational experience.
